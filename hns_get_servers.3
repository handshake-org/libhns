.TH HNS_GET_SERVERS 3 "5 March 2010"
.SH NAME
hns_get_servers, hns_get_servers_ports \- Retrieve name servers from an initialized hns_channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hns.h>
.PP
.B int hns_get_servers(hns_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct hns_addr_node **\fIservers\fP)
.B int hns_get_servers_ports(hns_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct hns_addr_port_node **\fIservers\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBhns_get_servers(3)\fP function retrieves name servers configuration
from the
channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
as a linked list of hns_addr_node structs storing a pointer to the first
node at the address specified by
.IR servers .

The \fBhns_get_servers_ports(3)\fP function also retrieves any per-server
port information that may have been previously configured, returning a linked
list of hns_addr_port structures.

Function caller may traverse the returned name server linked list, or may use
it directly as suitable input for the \fBhns_set_servers(3)\fP /
\fBhns_set_servers_ports(3)\fP functions, but
shall not shrink or extend the list on its own.

Each node of the name server linked list is stored in memory dynamically
allocated and managed by hns. It is the caller's responsibility to free
the resulting linked list, using \fBhns_free_data(3)\fP , once the caller
does not need it any longer.

This function is capable of handling IPv4 and IPv6 name server
addresses simultaneously, rendering \fBhns_save_options(3)\fP with
optmask \fBHNS_OPT_SERVERS\fP functionally obsolete except for
IPv4-only name server usage.

.SH RETURN VALUES
This function may return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B HNS_SUCCESS
The name servers configuration was successfully retrieved
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENOMEM
The memory was exhausted
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENODATA
The channel data identified by
.IR channel
was invalid.

.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBhns_get_servers(3)\fP was added in hns 1.7.1;
\fBhns_get_servers_ports(3)\fP was added in hns 1.11.0.
