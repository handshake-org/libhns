.TH HNS_SET_SERVERS 3 "5 March 2010"
.SH NAME
hns_set_servers, hns_set_servers_ports \- Initialize an hns_channel name servers configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hns.h>
.PP
.B int hns_set_servers(hns_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct hns_addr_node *\fIservers\fP)
.B int hns_set_servers_ports(hns_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct hns_addr_port_node *\fIservers\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBhns_set_servers(3)\fP function initializes name servers configuration
for the channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
from a
.IR servers
pointer to a linked list of hns_addr_node structs holding name servers
address data.
.PP
The name server linked list pointer argument may be the result of a previous
call to \fBhns_get_servers(3)\fP or a linked list of \fBhns_addr_node\fP structs
set up by other means.
.PP
The \fBhns_set_servers(3)\fP function also allows the specification of UDP and
TCP ports to be used for communication on a per-server basis.  The provided
linked list argument may be the result of a previous call to
\fBhns_get_servers_ports(3)\fP or a linked list of \fBhns_addr_port_node\fP structs
set up by other means.
.PP
This function replaces any potentially previously configured name servers
with the ones given in the linked list. So, in order to configure a channel
with more than one name server all the desired ones must be specified in a
single list.
.PP
The function does not take ownership of the linked list argument.
The caller is responsible for freeing the linked list when no longer needed.
.PP
This function is capable of handling IPv4 and IPv6 name server
addresses simultaneously, rendering \fBhns_init_options(3)\fP with
optmask \fBHNS_OPT_SERVERS\fP functionally obsolete except for
IPv4-only name server usage.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.B hns_set_servers(3)
may return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B HNS_SUCCESS
The name servers configuration was successfully initialized.
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENOMEM
The process's available memory was exhausted.
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENODATA
The channel data identified by 
.IR channel
was invalid.
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENOTINITIALIZED
hns library initialization not yet performed.
