.TH HNS_EXPAND_NAME 3 "20 Nov 2009"
.SH NAME
hns_expand_name \- Expand a DNS-encoded domain name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <hns.h>
.PP
.B int hns_expand_name(const unsigned char *\fIencoded\fP,
.B      const unsigned char *\fIabuf\fP, int \fIalen\fP, char **\fIs\fP,
.B 	long *\fIenclen\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hns_expand_name
function converts a DNS-encoded domain name to a dot-separated C
string.  The argument
.I encoded
gives the beginning of the encoded domain name, and the arguments
.I abuf
and
.I alen
give the containing message buffer (necessary for the processing of
indirection pointers within the encoded domain name).  The result is
placed in a NUL-terminated allocated buffer, a pointer to which is
stored in the variable pointed to by
.IR s .
The length of the encoded name is stored in the variable pointed to by
.I enclen
so that the caller can advance past the encoded domain name to read
further data in the message.

Use \fIhns_free_string(3)\fP to free the allocated hostname.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B hns_expand_name
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B HNS_SUCCESS
Expansion of the encoded name succeeded.
.TP 15
.B HNS_EBADNAME
The encoded domain name was malformed and could not be expanded.
.TP 15
.B HNS_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
