/*
 * NOTE 1:
 * -------
 *
 * Nothing in this file is intended to be modified or adjusted by the
 * hns library user nor by the hns library builder.
 *
 * If you think that something actually needs to be changed, adjusted
 * or fixed in this file, then, report it on the hns development
 * mailing list: http://cool.haxx.se/mailman/listinfo/c-ares/
 *
 * This header file shall only export symbols which are 'hns' or 'HNS'
 * prefixed, otherwise public name space would be polluted.
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 * -------
 *
 * Right now you might be staring at file hns_build.h.in or hns_build.h,
 * this is due to the following reason:
 *
 * On systems capable of running the configure script, the configure process
 * will overwrite the distributed hns_build.h file with one that is suitable
 * and specific to the library being configured and built, which is generated
 * from the hns_build.h.in template file.
