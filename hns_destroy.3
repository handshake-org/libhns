.TH HNS_DESTROY 3 "7 December 2004"
.SH NAME
hns_destroy \- Destroy a resolver channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <hns.h>

void hns_destroy(hns_channel \fIchannel\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBhns_destroy(3)\fP function destroys the name service channel
identified by \fIchannel\fP, freeing all memory and closing all sockets used
by the channel.

\fBhns_destroy(3)\fP invokes the callbacks for each pending query on the
channel, passing a status of \fIHNS_EDESTRUCTION\fP. These calls give the
callbacks a chance to clean up any state which might have been stored in their
arguments. A callback must not add new requests to a channel being destroyed.
